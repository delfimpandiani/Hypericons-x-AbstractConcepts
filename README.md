# Hypericons x Abstract Concepts

This repository contains the code used for the experiments presented in the paper: "Hypericons for Abstract Concepts: Non-traditional Approaches to Visual Explainability".

The directory is divided in three parts:

- 1. The ARTstract Dataset: a novel dataset of cultural images tagged with Abstract Concepts
- 2. Baseline Models: Baselines for the task of ACD (Abstract Concept Detection) in Cultural Images
- 3. Explainability Experiements: experiments of traditional (GRAD-CAM) and non-traditional (our novel SD-AM method) for visual interpretability of deep networks.

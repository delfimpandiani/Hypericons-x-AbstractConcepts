# Hypericons x Abstract Concepts

This repository contains the code used for the experiments presented in the paper: "Hypericons for Abstract Concepts: Non-traditional Approaches to Visual Explainability".

The directory is divided in three parts:

- 1. The ARTstract Dataset v0.1: a novel dataset of cultural images tagged with Abstract Concepts, in its first iteration.
- 2. Baselines for ACD: Baseline models (finetuned CNNs) for the task of ACD (Abstract Concept Detection) in Cultural Images
- 3. Explainability Experiments: experiments of traditional (GRAD-CAM) and non-traditional (our novel SD-AM method) for visual interpretability of deep networks.
